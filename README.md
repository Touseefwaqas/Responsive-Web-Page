In this basic web development project, I made a web page which is responsive. It is made with the mobile-first approach means code was first written for the screen of mobile then using media queries, it was made responsive for both medium and desktop screen sizes (Code written out of the media queries is for the mobile screen sizes, and in the media queries, it is written for larger screens using min-width).
This project is actually a final challenge from the course of Kewin Powell, Conquering Resonpsive Layouts. Kewin Powell gave this project as a final practice in one of his courses.
